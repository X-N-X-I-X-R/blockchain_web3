# How to work with the Hardhat console 

## **1. Introduction**

The Hardhat console is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your smart contracts directly from the command line. This is especially useful for debugging and testing your contracts. In this guide, we will
show you how to use the Hardhat console to interact with your smart contracts.

## **2. Prerequisites**

Before you can use the Hardhat console, you need to have a Hardhat project set up. If you don't have one yet, you can follow the instructions in the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/).

## **3. Using the Hardhat console**

To start the Hardhat console, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat console
```

This will start the Hardhat console and connect to your local Ethereum node. You should see a prompt that looks like this:

```bash
Hardhat network up to date
>
```

Now you can interact with your smart contracts using the Hardhat console. For example, you can deploy a new instance of your contract by running the following command:

```bash
const Lock = await ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");
const lock = await Lock.deploy();
await lock.deployed();
```

This will deploy a new instance of the `Lock` contract and store it in the `lock` variable. You can then interact with the contract using the `lock` variable. For example, you can call the `unlock` function like this:

```bash
await lock.unlock();
```

This will call the `unlock` function on the deployed contract. You can also call other functions on the contract and interact with its state variables in a similar way.

## **4. Conclusion**

The Hardhat console is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your smart contracts directly from the command line. This can be very useful for debugging and testing your contracts. We hope this guide has helped you understand how to use the Hardhat console and how it can be useful in your development workflow.

# More Useful Exemples of Hardhat Console Commands 

## **1. Deploying a Contract**

To deploy a contract using the Hardhat console, you can use the following commands:

```bash
const Lock = await ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");
const lock = await Lock.deploy();
await lock.deployed();
```

This will deploy a new instance of the `Lock` contract and store it in the `lock` variable. You can then interact with the contract using the `lock` variable.

## **2. Interacting with a Contract**

Once you have deployed a contract, you can interact with it using the Hardhat console. For example, you can call a function on the contract like this:

```bash
await lock.unlock();
```

This will call the `unlock` function on the deployed contract. You can also interact with the contract's state variables and call other functions in a similar way.

## **3. Accessing Contract Data**

You can also access data from the contract using the Hardhat console. For example, you can read the value of a state variable like this:

```bash
const unlockTime = await lock.unlockTime();
console.log(unlockTime.toString());
```

This will read the value of the `unlockTime` state variable from the deployed contract and log it to the console.

## **4. Sending Transactions**

You can also send transactions to the contract using the Hardhat console. For example, you can send Ether to the contract like this:

```bash
await lock.sendTransaction({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0") });
```

This will send 1 ETH to the deployed contract. You can also call other functions that modify the contract's state or send Ether to other addresses.

### **5. Viewing Contract Balance**

To check the balance of a contract, you can use the following command:

```bash
const balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(lock.address);
console.log(ethers.utils.formatEther(balance));
```

This will retrieve the current balance of the contract and display it in Ether.

---

### **6. Interacting with Other Deployed Contracts**

If you already have a deployed contract, you can interact with it using its address. For example:

```bash
const existingLock = await ethers.getContractAt("Lock", "0xYourContractAddress");
```

This will create a `Lock` contract instance at the specified address, allowing you to interact with it.

---

### **7. Sending Ether Between Accounts**

To send Ether between accounts, use the following command:

```bash
const [sender, receiver] = await ethers.getSigners();
await sender.sendTransaction({
  to: receiver.address,
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"),
});
```

This will transfer 1 ETH from `sender` to `receiver`.

---

### **8. Checking Account Balances**

To check the balance of an account, use the following command:

```bash
const [account] = await ethers.getSigners();
const balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(account.address);
console.log(`Balance: ${ethers.utils.formatEther(balance)} ETH`);
```

This will display the balance of the specified account in Ether.

---

### **9. Simulating Contract Calls**

You can simulate a contract call without actually sending a transaction by using the following:

```bash
const result = await lock.callStatic.someFunction(arg1, arg2);
console.log(result);
```

This will execute `someFunction` on the contract in a read-only manner, returning the result without modifying the blockchain.

---

### **10. Estimating Gas Costs**

To estimate the gas cost of a transaction, use:

```bash
const gasEstimate = await lock.estimateGas.someFunction(arg1, arg2);
console.log(`Estimated Gas: ${gasEstimate.toString()}`);
```

This will calculate and display the estimated gas cost for executing `someFunction` on the contract.

---

### **11. Impersonating Accounts (Advanced)**

If you're testing in a local environment, you can impersonate an account and send transactions from it:

```bash
await network.provider.request({
  method: "hardhat_impersonateAccount",
  params: ["0xAccountToImpersonate"],
});

const impersonatedSigner = await ethers.getSigner("0xAccountToImpersonate");
await impersonatedSigner.sendTransaction({
  to: "0xReceiverAddress",
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"),
});
```

This is useful for testing contracts that interact with external accounts.

---

### **12. Querying Past Events**

To query past events emitted by the contract, use:

```bash
const filter = lock.filters.Withdrawal();
const events = await lock.queryFilter(filter);
console.log(events);
```

This will retrieve all past `Withdrawal` events emitted by the `Lock` contract.

---

### **13. Setting Up a Listener for Events**

You can listen for events emitted by the contract in real time:

```bash
lock.on("Withdrawal", (amount, when, event) => {
  console.log(`Withdrawal of ${ethers.utils.formatEther(amount)} at ${when}`);
});
```

This will log every `Withdrawal` event emitted by the contract as they happen.

---

### **14. Advancing the Blockchain Time (Local Testing)**

If you're testing a time-based contract, you can advance the blockchain time in a local environment:

```bash
await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [3600]); // Advance time by 1 hour
await network.provider.send("evm_mine"); // Mine a new block
```

This is useful for testing contracts that depend on time.

---

### **15. Resetting the Blockchain State**

You can reset the blockchain to its initial state using:

```bash
await network.provider.request({
  method: "hardhat_reset",
  params: [],
});
```

This clears all transactions and reinitializes the local blockchain.

---

These examples should cover a wide range of use cases and demonstrate the flexibility of the Hardhat console.ðŸ˜Š
