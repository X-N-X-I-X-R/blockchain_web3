# NFT Creation Platform for Users

## **Project Description**
This platform empowers users to:
1. Upload simple elements (e.g., hairstyles, eyes, backgrounds).
2. Automatically generate **NFT collections** based on uploaded elements.
3. Sell their creations and earn from both initial sales and future resales (Royalties).

The goal is to create a platform that enables users, including those in challenging situations, to earn income by easily creating and selling NFTs.

## **Key Features**

### **1. NFT Generative Module**
- Users upload elements (like PNG files of different features).
- The system automatically generates unique NFT collections based on these elements.

### **2. User Management**
- Registration using email or crypto wallet (e.g., Metamask).
- Built-in wallet creation for non-technical users.
- Verification mechanism to prevent misuse.

### **3. Marketplace**
- A decentralized marketplace for selling NFTs.
- Support for fixed-price sales or auctions.
- Buyers can browse and purchase NFTs directly.

### **4. Royalties**
- Smart contracts ensure creators receive a percentage of every resale.
- Default split: 
  - **90%** to the user from the initial sale.
  - **10%** royalties for future sales.

### **5. Secure Storage**
- IPFS is used for decentralized storage of user-uploaded elements and NFT metadata.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**
- **React.js**: For a modern and accessible user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: For rapid and responsive design.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js** with **Express**: To manage the API and interaction with smart contracts.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data, creations, and transaction statuses.

### **Blockchain**
- **Polygon**: Chosen for lower gas fees and scalability.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized file storage.

### **AI for NFT Generation**
- Python with **Pillow** or **PyTorch** for combining uploaded elements into unique NFTs.

### **Smart Contracts**
- **ERC-721** or **ERC-1155** for NFTs.
- Custom royalty distribution contracts using OpenZeppelin.

## **User Workflow**

### **For Creators:**
1. **Sign Up/Log In:**
   - Register with email or connect with a crypto wallet like Metamask.
   - For non-crypto-savvy users, a wallet is created automatically.
2. **Upload Elements:**
   - Upload components (e.g., PNG images of eyes, hair, backgrounds).
   - The system saves the files in IPFS for decentralized storage.
3. **Generate NFTs:**
   - Automatically create an NFT collection from the uploaded elements.
   - Preview and approve the collection before publishing.
4. **Sell NFTs:**
   - Publish the collection on the marketplace.
   - Set prices or start an auction.

### **For Buyers:**
1. **Browse Marketplace:**
   - Explore available NFTs and collections.
2. **Purchase:**
   - Pay with cryptocurrency (ETH/MATIC).
   - The NFT is transferred to the buyer's wallet.
3. **Resale:**
   - List purchased NFTs for resale.
   - Original creators earn royalties from every resale.

## **Economic Model (Tokenomics)**

1. **For Users:**
   - Earn **90%** from the initial NFT sale.
   - Receive **10%** royalties from every subsequent resale.

2. **Platform Fees:**
   - The platform collects a 5%-10% fee from each transaction.
